# CodeSoft
Internship Project at Codsoft
During my Data Science Internship at Codsoft, I worked on a comprehensive data analysis and machine learning project. The primary objective was to analyze large datasets, identify key trends, and build predictive models to enhance business decision-making. Key tasks included:

Data Collection & Cleaning: Gathered and preprocessed data from multiple sources to ensure data integrity and quality.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to uncover insights, identify patterns, and visualize data trends.
Predictive Modeling: Developed and fine-tuned machine learning models to predict future trends, achieving significant accuracy improvements.
Visualization & Reporting: Created dashboards and visual reports to communicate findings to stakeholders effectively.
This project enhanced my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization, contributing to actionable insights for business growth.
