The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their
measurements. Now, imagine that you have the measurementsof Iris flowers categorized by their respective species. Your objective is to train a
machine learning model that can learn fromthese measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers intotheir respective species.

Use the Iris dataset to develop a model that can classify irisflowers into different species based on their sepal and petalmeasurements.
This dataset is widely used for introductory classification tasks.
